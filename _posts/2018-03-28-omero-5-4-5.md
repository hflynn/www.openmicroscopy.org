title: Release of OMERO 5.4.5
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.4.5.
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.4.5, a bug-fix release reactivating the
thumbnail cache inadvertently disabled in 5.4.4 while fixing a pyramid issue.

Improvements include:

* reactivated thumbnail caching
* improved removepyramids help
* fixed display of thumbnails when searching for images by ID
* increased OMERO.web log size
* fixed CLI config list subcommand
* fixed leaking services in OMERO.py
* improved rendering of non-tiled large images using OMERO.py and webgateway

This release does not upgrade the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses,
which remains at 5.7.3.

The software is also available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.5).
