We are pleased to announce that registration for the 2018 OME Annual Users Meeting is now open. [Register now](https://www.buyat.dundee.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/school-of-life-sciences/ome-annual-users-meeting/2018-ome-annual-users-meeting).

The meeting will be held May 30th - June 1st 2018 at the University of Dundee,
Scotland, UK.

Registration is open until 30th April 2018 and is Â£115 per person, including
lunches, refreshments, dinners on 30th and 31st May, and airport transfers by
bus if required.

You will be invited to give a lightning talk or present a poster during the
registration process. Please do consider presenting your work as these
contributions set the scene for the community priorities and requirements that
are the focus of the rest of the meeting. The deadline for lightning talk
titles and poster abstracts is Tuesday 8th May.

We are working on the [program]({{site.baseurl}}/events/13th-annual-users-meeting-2018.html) and
aim to release this in the next few weeks.

The Annual Meeting brings together members of OME and the wider imaging
community to discuss their work and define priorities for future development
of specifications and software. The meeting is an excellent opportunity for
members of the imaging community--developers, users, scientists from biology,
computing and data analysis--to meet and share their work, needs and visions
for driving discovery with imaging data.
