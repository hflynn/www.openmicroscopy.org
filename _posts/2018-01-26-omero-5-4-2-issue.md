title: OMERO 5.4.2 issue
intro-blurb: The OME team apologizes that there is an issue with OMERO.web 5.4.2
---
While upgrading our production servers to 5.4.2, we have identified a problem
afflicting OMERO.web. Long-running Python processes, like OMERO.webâ€™s gunicorn
workers, can leak file handles. After a period of usage, OMERO.web becomes
unstable and needs to be restarted.

We have now identified the issue and are testing a fix[^1]. In the meantime,
we recommend not upgrading to 5.4.2 if you are using OMERO.web: we will
release 5.4.3 early next week.

We unfortunately did not discover the issue during our testing since the
instability only arises after extended uptime. We will review our testing
process accordingly to avoid such problems in the future.

Thanks for your understanding and please accept our apologies.
