We are pleased to announce the release of OMERO.figure 1.2.0. This release introduces support for illustrative ROIs on figure panels. ROIs drawn in OMERO.figure cannot yet be saved as new ROIs on the OMERO server and it is not yet possible to load ROIs from OMERO to use in OMERO.figure.

- ROIs can be drawn on individual panels
- Currently supports rectangle, line, arrow and ellipse
- ROIs can be copied and pasted between panels
- Rectangles can be pasted as a crop region on another panel

Watch a demonstration of the new ROI features and workflows below:

Known Issues:

- The ROI viewer for drawing and editing ROIs does not support rotated image
  panels. Therefore, rotated panels are displayed without rotation while
  adding ROIs in the ROI viewer
- Rectangle ROIs cannot be rotated. Therefore, crop regions from rotated
  images will lose their rotation when pasted to create ROI rectangles
- ROIs extending outside of panels are not cropped to the panel when exported
  to PDF
