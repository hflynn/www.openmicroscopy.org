title: Release of OME Files C++ 0.5.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OME Files C++ 0.5.0
---
OME Files is a reference implementation of the OME Data Model and
OME-TIFF file format for the storage and interchange of biological
imaging data and metadata.  It provides support for:

- the OME Data Model (model objects, metadata store, XSL transforms
  and XML validation)
- OME-TIFF reading
- OME-TIFF writing

The main change in this release is the re-addition of compatibility
code to permit building on CentOS7 and RHEL7 with EPEL.  Other work
includes the switch to C++11 threads and mutexes from the Boost
equivalents, and preliminary CMake support for building with C++17
compilers.

**Downloads**

The software release is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ome-files-cpp/0.5.0/25/).
This includes the source releases, as well as the documentation and
binary builds of the collection for several common platforms,
including Windows, Linux and MacOS X.
