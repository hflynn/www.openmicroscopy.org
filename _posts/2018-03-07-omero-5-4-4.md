intro-blurb: The OME team announces the release of OMERO 5.4.4.
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.4.4, a bug-fix release which also introduces
some new functionality.

It includes a security fix for [2017-SV6 Job-File Link]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2017-SV6-job-file-link/).
It is highly recommended that you upgrade your server.

Improvements include:

* images can now be filtered by Tag in the center panel of OMERO.web
* enabled search by "File" and "Tag" annotations separately in OMERO.web, as
  opposed to only being able to search by All annotations
* fixed switching between grid display and thumbnail display in OMERO.web
* fixed the image preview and disabled projection in OMERO.insight when
  trying to project an image with all the channels turned off
* fixed parsing of polygons and polyline ROIs so they can be opened in ImageJ
* fixed creation of OMERO pyramids for little-endian files
* improved error message when login fails for OMERO.insight
* improved handling of idle connections in OMERO.insight
* improved loading speed of LUT
* OMERO.insight and OMERO.importer are now compatible with Java 9

Sysadmin improvements include:

* improved installation documentation for OMERO.web, and OMERO.server on
  Debian 9, Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7
* added an admin command and script to allow deletion of corrupted pyramids
  created by a bug introduced with OMERO 5.2 (new uncorrupted pyramids can
  then be generated - see
  [Server Upgrade](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero5.4/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html)
  for details)
* allowed enforcement of a secure connection when importing data
* added commands to the CLI sessions plugin to enable the creation and
  removal of user sessions

Developer updates include:

* improved test infrastructure and coverage
* allowed filtering by namespace (ns) in webclient, API and annotations
* added support for more rendering parameters to the API
* added the option to respect a specific tile size
* added a method to load planes using JavaGateway
* added an example to the documentation for using "sudo" to create sessions
  for others with the JavaGateway
* documentation is now compatible with Sphinx 1.7

This release does not upgrade the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses,
which remains at 5.7.3.
