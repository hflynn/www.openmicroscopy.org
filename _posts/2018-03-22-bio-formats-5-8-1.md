title: Release of Bio-Formats 5.8.1
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 5.8.1
---

Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.8.1 which includes the following changes:

File format fixes and improvements:

* TIFF
    * updated TiffWriter so that planes will no longer be split when using
      non-standard SamplesPerPixel e.g. images with 2 or 4 samples per pixel.
      This will ensure the ``TiffData`` elements represent the structure
      specified by the user. If users wish to split planes the
      ``ChannelSeparator`` and ``bfconvert`` provide the means to do this
      explicitly
    * updated TiffWriter to use the correct logic for index checking when
      writing tiled images
    * fixed a ``ClassCastException`` when the ``NEW_SUBFILE_TYPE`` tag has a
      non-standard type or count such that the value is not inlined
    * updated to also check the last IFD for an ImageJ comment in the scenario
      that the image has been processed by other software
* NRRD (Nearly Raw Raster Data)
    * added support for ``space directions`` and ``space units`` fields added
      in version 4
* Evotec/PerkinElmer Opera Flex
    * updated to read rather than calculate image offsets when a single tile
      is used

Bug fixes and improvements:

* limited the number of exceptions in the Bio-Formats plugins exporter when an
  unsupported pixel type is found
* fake test images now allow for per-plane ExposureTime{X,Y,Z} and
  Position{X,Y,Z} keys in the INI file (for further details see the
  documentation for [Generating test images](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/developers/generating-test-images.html)
* file patterns now have expanded support for multi-channel pyramids, allowing
  for the matching of at least two channels rather than three, and the
  stitching of files containing a pyramid has also been fixed

Documentation improvements:

* improved testing of external links


Full details can be found at [Bio-Formats version history](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.8.1/about/whats-new.html).

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.8.1)
and will shortly be available from the Java-8 update site for Fiji users.
