We are pleased to announce that the 2018 OME Annual Users Meeting will be
held May 30th - June 1st 2018 in Dundee.

We are working on the [program]({{site.baseurl}}/events/13th-annual-users-meeting-2018.html) and
aim to release this in the next few weeks. We'll also post
registration and accommodation details as soon as possible.

The format will be similar to last year with a day of talks from the community
and invited speakers, followed by a day of workshops, and a final more
informal day for discussions and collaborations. If youâ€™ve never joined us
before, you can find recent programs in the
[Events section]({{site.baseurl}}/events/) to give you an idea of what to
expect.

Dundee is a hot destination in 2018
(one of [CNN's 'Coolest 7 cities to look out for in 2018'](http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/cities-to-watch-in-2018/index.html)
no less) so come join us for a packed program and no doubt some social fun
too!
