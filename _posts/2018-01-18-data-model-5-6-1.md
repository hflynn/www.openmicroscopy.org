title: Release of OME Data Model 5.6.1
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OME Data Model 5.6.1
---
The OME Data Model has been updated to version 5.6.1. This update includes
documentation improvements and does not involve any changes to the Data Model
Schema version (which remains at June 2016 release 2).

You can find full details of the recent changes in the
[NEWS file](https://github.com/ome/ome-model/blob/v5.6.1/NEWS.md). Note that
the versioning policy reflects updates to any components of the OME Model and
is therefore incremented more frequently than the Schema version (the version
history of which can be found in the
[documentation](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/ome-model/#data-model-history)).

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
