                We have set up <a href="https://github.com/ome/training-repos/" target="_blank">ome/training-repos</a>, a super-module on GitHub which
                collects together all the repositories and reference to the
                material used for general training sessions.
            </p>
            <h4>Set-up</h4>
            <p>
                For any training session, we use a dedicated server with the
                latest released version of OMERO and OMERO.web apps
                installed. The walkthrough materials used during the sessions
                refer to the content of that server.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to use a similar set-up, you can run the
                <a href="https://github.com/openmicroscopy/prod-playbooks/blob/master/ome-dundeeomero.yml" target="_blank">Ansible playbook</a>
                to deploy the server and the apps. Note that it is only
                currently available for CentOS 7.
                Users will then need to be created and data imported for each
                user. We recommend using <a href="https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero/sysadmins/in-place-import.html" target="_blank">in-place-import</a> to reduce the size
                allocated for data. We offer a script (see below) to import
                in-place data for the users in the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                We offer a collection of useful scripts to set up and manage
                the training server: to create users, in-place import data,
                create annotations for all users, clean up post-training
                session, etc.
                The scripts can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ome/training-scripts/tree/master/maintenance" target="_blank">https://github.com/ome/training-scripts/tree/master/maintenance.</a>
                These scripts can be used against any server.

            <h4>Data</h4>
            <p>
                All the data used during the sessions are publicly available.
                The file data.txt indicates where to find the images and in
                which datasets they have been imported.

            <h4>Presentations</h4>
            <p>
                Presentations and walkthroughs are publicly available.
                The length of the walkthroughs varies according to the
                duration of the workshops. We currently have materials for
                workshops run for 1-2 hours and 1-2 days.
            </p>

                All presentations can be download from

                session.
